          <h3>
            Focuses on securing computer networks from unauthorized access, data
            breaches, and other network-based threats. It involves technologies
            such as Firewalls, Intrusion detection systems (IDS), Virtual
            private networks (VPNs), and Network segmentation.

              Sometimes we used to utilize free Wi-Fi in public areas such as
              cafes, Malls, etc. With this activity, 3rd Party starts tracking
              your Phone over the internet. If you are using any payment
              gateway, then your bank account can be Empty.
