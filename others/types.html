              Sometimes we used to utilize free Wi-Fi in public areas such as
              cafes, Malls, etc. With this activity, 3rd Party starts tracking
              your Phone over the internet. If you are using any payment

              All of the physical and virtual resources, systems, and networks
              that are necessary for a society’s economics, security, or any
              combination of the above to run smoothly are referred to as
              critical infrastructure. Food and agricultural industries, as well

              Industrial control systems (ICS), such as supervisory control and
              data acquisition (SCADA) systems, which are used to automate
              industrial operations in critical infrastructure industries, are
              frequently included in critical infrastructure. SCADA and other
              industrial control system attacks are very concerning. They have
              the capacity to seriously undermine critical infrastructure,
              including transportation, the supply of oil and gas, electrical
              grids, water distribution, and wastewater collection.

              Devices frequently run on old software, leaving them vulnerable to
              recently identified security vulnerabilities. This is generally
