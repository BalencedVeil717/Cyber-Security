      <h1>Cyber Attack Examples</h1>

          <h2>Kaseya Ransomware Attack</h2>
          <p>
            Kaseya, a US-based provider of remote management software,
            experienced a supply chain attack, which was made public on July 2,
            2021. The company announced that attackers could use its VSA product
            to infect customer machines with ransomware.
            <br />
            The attack was reported to be highly sophisticated, chaining
            together several new vulnerabilities discovered in the Kaseya
            product: CVE-2021-30116 (credentials leak and business logic flaw),
            CVE-2021-30119 (XSS), and CVE-2021-30120 (two-factor authentication
            flaw). The malware exploiting these vulnerabilities was pushed to
            customers using a fake software update labelled “Kaseya VSA Agent
            Hot Fix”.
            <br />
            The attack was carried out by the Russian-based REvil cybercrime
            group. Kaseya said less than 0.1% of their customers were affected
            by the breach, however, some of them were managed service providers
            (MSP) who used Kaseya software, and the attack affected their
            customers. A short time after the attack, press reports said
            800-1500 small to mid-sized companies were infected by REvil
            ransomware as a result of the attack.

          <h2>SolarWinds Supply Chain Attack</h2>
          <p>
            This was a massive, highly innovative supply chain attack detected
            in December 2020, and named after its victim, Austin-based IT
            management company SolarWinds. It was conducted by APT 29, an
            organized cybercrime group connected to the Russian government.
            <br />
            The attack compromised an update meant for SolarWinds’s software
            platform, Orion. During the attack, threat actors injected malware,
            which came to be known as the Sunburst or Solorigate malware—into
            Orion’s updates. The updates were then distributed to SolarWinds
            customers.
            <br />
            The SolarWinds attack is considered one of the most serious cyber
            espionage attacks on the United States, because it successfully
            breached the US military, many US-based federal agencies, including
            agencies responsible for nuclear weapons, critical infrastructure
            services, and a majority of Fortune 500 organizations.

          <h2>Amazon DDoS Attack</h2>
          <p>
            In February 2020, Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the target of a
            large-scale distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. The company
            experienced and mitigated a 2.3 Tbps (terabits per second) DDoS
            attack, which had a packet forwarding rate of 293.1 Mpps and a
            request rate per second (rps) of 694,201. It is considered one of
            the largest DDoS attacks in history.

          <h2>Microsoft Exchange Remote Code Execution Attack</h2>
          <p>
            In March 2021, a large-scale cyber attack was carried out against
            Microsoft Exchange, a popular enterprise email server. It leveraged
            four separate zero-day vulnerabilities discovered in Microsoft
            Exchange servers.
            <br />
            These vulnerabilities enable attackers to forge untrusted URLs, use
            them to access an Exchange Server system, and provide a direct
            server-side storage path for malware. It is a Remote Code Execution
            (RCE) attack, which allows attackers to completely compromise a
            server and gain access to all its data. On affected servers,
            attackers stole sensitive information, injected ransomware, and
            deployed backdoors in a way that was almost untraceable.
            <br />
            In the United States alone, the attacks affected nine government
            agencies and more than 60,000 private businesses.

          <h2>Twitter Celebrities Attack</h2>
          <p>
            In July 2020, Twitter was breached by a group of three attackers,
            who took over popular Twitter accounts. They used social engineering
            attacks to steal employee credentials and gain access to the
            company’s internal management systems, later identified by Twitter
            as vishing (phone phishing).
            <br />
            Dozens of well-known accounts were hacked, including Barack Obama,
            Jeff Bezos, and Elon Musk. The attackers used the stolen accounts to
            post bitcoin scams and earned more than $100,000. Two weeks after
            the events, the US Justice Department charged three suspects, one of
            whom was 17 years old at the time.
