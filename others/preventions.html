          Mentioned below is a comprehensive list of tips and measures that an
          individual can take to protect themselves from cybercrime:

      </h2>
      <br /><br /><br />
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h2>Use strong passwords</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            One of the simplest ways to prevent cyber crimes is to use strong
            passwords. Don’t go for 123456…and other simple passwords that are
            too easy to guess. Don’t use the names of your partners or dear ones
            or your birth date as your password. Instead, use a unique password
            that is a combination of alphabets, numerals, and special
            characters/symbols. Another trick is to use different passwords for
            different sites and change your passwords frequently.

        <br />
        <li>
          <h2>Keeping your software updated</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Keep checking for the updates for your operating system and internet
            security software. Generally, cybercriminals take advantage of the
            glitches and flaws in your software for gaining access to your
            systems and devices. Thus, keeping your software updated to the
            latest version takes you one step closer to preventing cyber crimes.
          </p>
        </li>
        <br /><br />
        <div class="hr"></div>
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>
          <h2>Manage your social media settings</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            The next easy thing that you can do is keep your personal
            information private. Social media platforms usually have a feature
            where that allows you to hide your phone numbers and other
            contact/personal information. It might be a reasonable choice to
            hide such information and keep it locked down from the public eye
            for if you disclose your pet’s name in your public profile, you are
            giving away the answer to one of the most basic security questions.
          </p>

        <div class="hr"></div>
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>
          <h2>Strengthening your network</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Use strong encryption passwords to protect your home network from
            hackers and unwanted interceptions. If you are someone who uses
            public WI-FI, you must use a VPN(Virtual Private Network). A VPN
            encrypts all traffic until it reaches your computer. Thus, even if
            hackers can hack your communication line, they won’t intercept
            anything but encrypted data.
          </p>
        </li>

        <div class="hr"></div>
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>
          <h2>Keep yourself up to date on major security breaches</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            We often read about security breaches and theft of user information
            stored by various websites. If you have an account on any of these
            websites which have been impacted by the breach, you should check
            out what information the hackers have accessed and change your
            passwords immediately.
          </p>

        <div class="hr"></div>
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>
          <h2>Talk to children about the internet</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Even before the pandemic happened, children were already using the
            internet and mobile, and computer devices to a great extent and the
            pandemic only intensified it. The internet and technology have
            become a necessity in a student’s life. But do we teach our kids
            about the pros and cons of the internet? Every parent must talk to
            their child about the cautious use of the internet and the risks
            that come with it. Essentially, you must make sure that your child
            comes to you if he or she is experiencing any form of online
            harassment, abuse, or any other cyber-criminal activity.

          <h2>Protect yourself from identity theft</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            You can protect yourself from identity theft by taking the following
            precautions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>Beware of shoulder surfing.</p></li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <p>
                Do not reply to spam emails or open URLs or click on links in
                unsolicited mails.
              </p>
            </li>
            <br />
            <li><p>Use robust passwords and practise safe clicking.</p></li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <p>
                Always verify the identity of the person asking for your
                personal information.
              </p>
            </li>
            <br />
          </ul>
        </li>

        <div class="hr"></div>
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>
          <h2>Install anti-virus software</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Installing reputed anti-virus software or internet security
            solutions can go a long way in protecting you from cyber crimes.
            These softwares such as avast provides you maximum protection and
            contains features such as virus cleaner, VPN, app locks, monitoring
            leaked passwords, etc. Anti-virus software allows you to scan,
            detect and remove threats before they become a problem. Also, please
            make sure that your antivirus software is kept updated.
          </p>

        <div class="hr"></div>

        <li>
          <h2>Check your bank statements</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            It is advised that you should regularly check your bank account
            statements and in case you notice some unfamiliar transactions, or
            unauthorised withdrawals, you can report the same to the bank.
          </p>
        </li>
        <br /><br />
        <div class="hr"></div>

        <li>
          <h2>Protect yourself from phishing</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            The first thing you can do to avoid a phishing attack is to learn to
            recognize it. Here’s how-typically, phishing attacks call for an
            urgent action prompting you to click some link or act immediately to
            claim this lucrative reward and so on. Here are the other things
            that you can do to avoid becoming a victim of phishing attacks:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                A mail from a first-time sender might be a sign of phishing.
                Therefore, be extra cautious when you receive mail from an
                unknown person.
              </p>
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <p>
                If the mail you got has bad grammar and obvious spelling errors,
                there is a good chance that it is a scam. This is because these
                emails are usually translated into foreign languages. Also,
                reputed organisations do not generally send emails with spelling
                errors
              </p>
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <p>
                Beware of generic greetings. In the time we live in,
                organisations that you deal with know your details and they
                usually address you with your name. Thus, if you receive a
                letter with a generic greeting ‘Dear mam or sir’ from your bank,
                there is a chance that it is not your bank after all.
              </p>
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <p>
                If you suspect that you have received spam mail, or that the
                email message is a scam, avoid clicking any links that may be
                inside it.
              </p>
            </li>
            <br />

          <br />
          <ul>
            <li><p>Don’t share your location on social media publicly</p></li>

            <li>
              <p>
                While making online purchases, ensure that the website is

            <li>
              <p>
                Do not share your OTP, and CVV codes with anyone. Trusted banks
                and financial institutions will never ask for this information.
              </p>

                Understand the nature and importance of the data that you store
                on your devices. Creating a backup of your data and files is a
                good option to mitigate the loss in case of a malware attack
                etc.

                Enabling multi-factor authentication is another option that you
                can explore to level up your security. Setting and modifying
