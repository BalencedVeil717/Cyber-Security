          Building a proactive cyber security and detection capability is
          difficult for countries. As cyber-attacks become more complex, states
          need cybersecurity that not only protects today but provides proactive
          defense against new and future risks to confidently respond to new
          challenges. Read here to know more about India’s cyber security
          capabilities.

      <p>
        The internet has merged seamlessly into our daily lives. It has changed
        how we interact with others, make new acquaintances, share information,
        engage in entertainment, and shop.<br /><br />
        The majority of our daily activities are being impacted by them. We
        virtually communicate with billions of online users around the world
        through cyberspace.
        <br /><br />
        Cybercrimes including cyberstalking, cyberbullying, cyberharassment,
        child pornography, rape content, etc., targeting women and children, in
        particular, are fast rising along with the usage of cyberspace.
        <br /><br />
        Education is one of the major sectors for dissemination of information
        on the prevention of cyber-crimes and reaffirmed that students can act,
        as a force multiplier to establish an ecosystem for cyber security and
        to prevent cyber crimes.

      <h1>What is Cyber Warfare?</h1>
      <p>
        A cyberattack or series of attacks that target a nation is typically
        referred to as cyberwarfare. It can destroy civilian and governmental
        infrastructure and interfere with vital processes, causing harm to the
        state and possibly even fatalities.
        <br /><br />
        The majority of the time, nation-states engage in cyber warfare by
        attacking other nations, but occasionally, terrorist groups or non-state
        actors carry out the assaults to further the objectives of an adversary
        state.
        <br /><br />
        There have been many reported instances of cyber warfare in recent
        years, but there is no established definition of what constitutes an act
        of war in the context of a cyber strike.
      </p>
      <h2>There are 7 main types of cyber warfare attacks:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3>Espionage:</h3>
          <p>
            Refers to monitoring other countries to steal secrets. In cyber
            warfare, this can involve using botnets or spear phishing attacks to
            compromise sensitive computer systems before exfiltrating sensitive
            information.
          </p>
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <h3>Sabotage:</h3>
          <p>
            Government organizations must determine sensitive information and
            the risks if it is compromised. Hostile governments or terrorists
            may steal information, destroy it, or leverage insider threats such
            as dissatisfied or careless employees, or government employees with
            affiliation to the attacking country.
          </p>
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <h3>Denial-of-service (DoS) Attacks:</h3>
          <p>
            DoS attacks prevent legitimate users from accessing a website by
            flooding it with fake requests and forcing the website to handle
            these requests. This type of attack can be used to disrupt critical
            operations and systems and block access to sensitive websites by
            civilians, military and security personnel, or research bodies.
          </p>
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <h3>Electrical Power Grid:</h3>
          <p>
            Attacking the power grid allows attackers to disable critical
            systems, disrupt infrastructure, and potentially result in bodily
            harm. Attacks on the power grid can also disrupt communications and
            render services such as text messages and communications unusable.
          </p>
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <h3>Propaganda Attacks:</h3>
          <p>
            Attempts to control the minds and thoughts of people living in or
            fighting for a target country. Propaganda can be used to expose
            embarrassing truths, spread lies to make people lose trust in their
            country, or side with their enemies.
          </p>
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <h3>Economic Disruption:</h3>
          <p>
            Most modern economic systems operate using computers. Attackers can
            target computer networks of economic establishments such as stock
            markets, payment systems, and banks to steal money or block people
            from accessing the funds they need.
          </p>
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <h3>Surprise Attacks:</h3>
          <p>
            These are the cyber equivalent of attacks like Pearl Harbor and
            9/11. The point is to carry out a massive attack that the enemy
            isn’t expecting, enabling the attacker to weaken their defenses.
            This can be done to prepare the ground for a physical attack in the
            context of hybrid warfare.

      <h1>Cyber-attacks in India</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Recently, the servers of Delhi AIIMS were compromised due to a
            ransomware cyber-attack. The personal data of millions of patients
            in the top premier medical institute is at risk after a ransomware
            attack on its servers.
          </p>
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <p>
            In February 2022, Air India experienced a major cyberattack that
            compromised approximately 4.5 million customer records. Passport,
            ticket, and some credit card information were compromised.
          </p>
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <p>
            In 2020, approximately 82% of Indian companies suffered ransomware
            attacks.
          </p>
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <p>
            In 2021, A high-profile India-based payment company, Juspay,
            suffered a data breach impacting 35 million customers. This breach
            is very noteworthy because Juspay handles payments for online
            marketplaces, including Amazon and other big players.
          </p>
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <p>
            In May 2017, the top five cities in India (Kolkata, Delhi,
            Bhubaneswar, Pune, and Mumbai) got impacted due to the WannaCry
            ransomware attack.

      <h1>India's Cyber security</h1>
      <p>
        A simultaneous surge in cyber risks has grown more worrisome as India’s
        internet base expands, with over 900 internet users anticipated by 2025.
        With the development of digital technology, cybercrimes are becoming
        more sophisticated as well.
        <br /><br />
        India must therefore carefully assess the vulnerabilities in its
        cyberspace and address them holistically through a more thorough
        Cyber-Security Policy.
        <br /><br />
        A cyber and information security division operates under the aegis of
        the Ministry of home affairs which deals with matters relating to Cyber
        Security, Cyber Crime, National Information Security Policy & Guidelines
        (NISPG), and implementation of NISPG, NATGRID, etc.
      </p>
      <div class="hr"></div>
      <h1>Challenges to India’s cyber security</h1>
      <ol>
        <li><h3>Devices used for internet access are not all the same:</h3></li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Not everyone in India can buy pricey phones due to the wide range
              of economic levels.
            </p>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <p>
              Apple holds a market share of nearly 44% in the US. Less than 1%
              of mobile users in India, despite the greater security standards,
              use iPhones.
            </p>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <p>
              It is becoming increasingly difficult for regulators to define
              legal and technical requirements for data protection due to the
              growing security gap between high-end mobile devices like the
              iPhone and less expensive ones.
            </p>
          </li>
          <br />
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        <li>
          <h3>Lack of a national-level architecture for cybersecurity:</h3>
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              The military has its firefighting organizations, while critical
              infrastructure is owned by the commercial sector.
            </p>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <p>
              To analyze the nature of any danger and effectively counter it,
              all of these agencies must work together as part of a national
              security architecture, which does not yet exist.
            </p>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <p>
              The Prime Minister’s Office has established a position in support
              of this cause, although India still lacks the required
              infrastructure.
            </p>
          </li>
          <br />
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        <li><h3>Lack of separation:</h3></li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Unlike countries or governments, cyberspace has no borders, making
              it possible for cyberattacks to come from anywhere on the armed
              forces, digital assets of ONGC, banking operations, etc.
            </p>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <p>
              This might lead to national security lapses that cost money,
              property, or even lives.
            </p>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <p>
              There is a need for a technically advanced multi-agency
              organization that can base its judgments on policy inputs and a
              strong strategy to respond to potential threats to the nation’s
              most valuable resources.
            </p>
          </li>
          <br />
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        <li><h3>Lack of awareness:</h3></li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Since there is no national regulatory policy in place for
              cybersecurity, both businesses and individuals lack awareness.
            </p>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <p>
              Only in the presence of a regulated and overseen legislative
              framework can domestic internet users defend themselves and
              receive protection from cyberattacks.
