          <h1>What Are Cyber Attacks?</h1>
          <p>
            A cyber attack is any intentional effort to steal, expose, alter, or
            destroy data, applications, or other assets through unauthorized
            access to a network, computer system, or digital device.

          <h1>Why Cyber Security Awareness Is Important?</h1>
          <p>
            Cyber Security Awareness is crucial in today’s digital age. It is
            the process of educating people to understand, identify, and avoid
            cyber threats. The ultimate goal is to prevent or mitigate harm to
            both the organization and its stakeholders and reduce human cyber
            risk. Cyber security awareness training helps prevent breaches,
            which can be costly for organizations. In 2022, the average cost of
            a data breach was just under $4.35 million. In addition, 70% of data
            breaches involved the human element in 2023. By prioritizing cyber
            security, organizations can mitigate the risk of data breaches,
            financial losses, and reputational damage. Cyber security awareness
            helps educate employees about malicious methods used by cyber
            criminals, how they can be easy targets, how to spot potential
            threats, and what they can do to avoid falling victim to these
            insidious threats. It is essential to promote enterprise-wide
            knowledge of cyber attacks to halt cyber criminals in their tracks
            globally.

        <h1>TYPES OF CYBER ATTACKS</h1>
        <div class="malware">
          <h1>Malware</h1>
          <br />
          <p>
            Malware is a form of application that performs nefarious activities.
            Some types of malware are designed to create access to networks,
            some to spy on credentials while others are simply used to cause
            disruption.
            <br />
            Malware can be used for extortion as well. An example of this can be
            found in the Ransomware attacks of 2017 where a program was designed
            to encrypt the victim’s files and then ask them to pay a ransom to
            get the decryption key.
          </p>

        <div class="phishing">
          <h1>Phishing</h1>
          <br />
          <p>
            In Phishing, an attacker tricks an unsuspecting target into handing
            over valuable information, such as passwords, credit card details,
            etc.
            <br />
            An example of this is a message regarding One-Time Passwords (OTP).
            A hacker using a phishing method will send a clickable link where a
            user can submit their OTPs. Once the link is clicked a hacker will
            have access to the user's personal information.
            <br />
            Phishing is a common form of cyber attack due to its effectiveness
            and simplistic execution pattern.

        </div>
        <div class="mitm">
          <h1>Man-in-the-middle attack (MITM)</h1>
          <br />
          <p>
            A man-in-the-middle attack (MITM) consists of a message interception
            between two parties in an attempt to spy on the targets.
            <br />
            Due to the advent of end-to-end encryption, MITM attacks have taken
            a dip in the frequency of attacks. Such encryptions prevent third
            parties from intercepting or tampering data transmitted in the
            network. Whether the network is secure or not is hardly a factor.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="ddos">
          <h1>Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)</h1>
          <br />
          <p>
            In a DDoS attack, an attacker floods a target server with traffic
            that will disrupt it. Since most servers cannot handle it, it may
            lead to services slowing down on the website and it eventually
            crashes.
            <br />
            Unlike standard denial-of-service attacks, DDoS uses multiple
            compromised devices to bombard the target server, which
            sophisticated firewalls cannot respond to or are unable to.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="injection">
          <h1>SQL Injection</h1>
          <p>
            This type of cyber attack targets specific SQL databases. These
            databases use SQL statements for data queries. In case permissions
            are not set properly, a hacker can manipulate SQL queries into
            changing the data if not deleting them altogether.

        <div class="zeroday">
          <h1>Zero-day exploit</h1>
          <br />
          <p>
            When cyber-criminals learn of a vulnerability in a frequently used
            software application they target users and organizations using the
            software to exploit it until a fix is available. This is called a
            Zero-day exploit.

        <div class="dnstunnelling">
          <h1>DNS Tunnelling</h1>
          <br />
          <p>
            A DNS Tunnelling provides attackers with a stable and consistent
            line of communication to the given target. The malware used will
            gather information as long as the DNS tunneling is active. Chances
            are that firewalls won’t be able to detect such an attack.
          </p>

        <div class="bec">
          <h1>Business Email Compromise (BEC)</h1>
          <br />
          <p>
            In a BEC attack, hackers target employees who have specific
            authority to finalize business transactions. They trick them into
            transferring money into an account belonging to the hacker.
            <br />
            BEC attacks are the most common, if not one of the most damaging
            attacks for a business firm.

        <div class="cryptojacking">
          <h1>Cryptojacking</h1>
          <br />
          <p>
            Cryptojacking is used to target a computer to mine cryptocurrencies
            such as Bitcoin. The hackers will be able to get all the
            cryptocurrency they can instead of the original owners.
            Cryptojacking is not so widely known but its severity cannot be
            underestimated.

        <div class="driveby">
          <h1>Drive-by Attack</h1>
          <br />
          <p>
            A website is loaded with malware, and when a visitor happens to come
            across such a website their device is infected with the malware. The
            malware will steal valuable data or crash the system.s

        <h1>Tips for protecting yourself from cyberattacks</h1>
        <p>
          Individuals and organizations can take simple steps to prevent data
          breaches and keep their information secure.
          <br />
          The first and most basic step in maintaining cybersecurity is to
          create a unique and original password for each account. Users should
          also remember to update passwords every three months.
          <br />
          Keeping up with software updates is important, as cybercriminals often
          target known flaws in software to access a user’s system.
          <br />
          Cybercriminals may comb through social media posts in search of
          information commonly used in security questions, such as a pet’s name
          or mother’s maiden name. To combat this risk, social media users
          should set their account to private or avoid revealing sensitive
          information in posts.
          <br />
          A virtual private network (VPN) is a great way to protect sensitive
          data, especially when accessing a public Wi-Fi network. A VPN encrypts
          all information transmitted by your device and helps prevent many
          types of cyberattacks.
          <br />
          And finally, teachers and parents should educate children about proper
          internet usage. Children and teens should know what the rules and
          guidelines are for surfing the internet and using social media.
