            <div><h1>What Are Cyber Attacks?</h1>

            <div><h1>Why Cyber Security Awareness Is Important?</h1>
                <h2>Cybersecurity awareness is crucial in todayâ€™s digital age. It is the process of educating people to understand, identify, and avoid cyber threats. The ultimate goal is to prevent or mitigate harm to both the organization and its stakeholders and reduce human cyber risk. Cybersecurity awareness training helps prevent breaches, which can be costly for organizations. In 2022, the average cost of a data breach was just under $4.35 million. In addition, 70% of data breaches involved the human element in 2023. By prioritizing cybersecurity, organizations can mitigate the risk of data breaches, financial losses, and reputational damage. Cybersecurity awareness helps educate employees about malicious methods used by cybercriminals, how they can be easy targets, how to spot potential threats, and what they can do to avoid falling victim to these insidious threats. It is essential to promote enterprise-wide knowledge of cyberattacks to halt cybercriminals in their tracks globally.</h2></div>
