          <h1>What Are Cyber Attacks?</h1>
          <h2>
            A cyberattack is any intentional effort to steal, expose, alter,
            disable, or destroy data, applications or other assets through
            unauthorized access to a network, computer system or digital device.

          <h1>Why Cyber Security Awareness Is Important?</h1>
          <h2>
            Cybersecurity awareness is crucial in today’s digital age. It is the
            process of educating people to understand, identify, and avoid cyber
            threats. The ultimate goal is to prevent or mitigate harm to both
            the organization and its stakeholders and reduce human cyber risk.
            Cybersecurity awareness training helps prevent breaches, which can
            be costly for organizations. In 2022, the average cost of a data
            breach was just under $4.35 million. In addition, 70% of data
            breaches involved the human element in 2023. By prioritizing
            cybersecurity, organizations can mitigate the risk of data breaches,
            financial losses, and reputational damage. Cybersecurity awareness
            helps educate employees about malicious methods used by
            cybercriminals, how they can be easy targets, how to spot potential
            threats, and what they can do to avoid falling victim to these
            insidious threats. It is essential to promote enterprise-wide
            knowledge of cyberattacks to halt cybercriminals in their tracks
            globally.

        <div class="malware">
            <h1>Malware</h1>
            <br />
            <h2>
              Malware is a form of application that performs nefarious
              activities. Some types of malware are designed to create access to
              networks, some to spy on credentials while others are simply used
              to cause disruption.
              <br />
              Malwares can be used for extortion as well. An example of it can
              be found in Ransomware attacks of 2017 where a program was
              designed to encrypt the victim’s files and then ask them to pay a
              ransom in order to get the decryption key.

          <div class="phishing">
            <h1>Phishing</h1>
            <br />
            <h2>
              In Phishing, an attacker tricks an unsuspecting target into
              handing over valuable information, such as passwords, credit card
              details, etc.
              <br />
              An example of this is a message regarding One-Time Passwords
              (OTP). A hacker using a phishing method will send a clickable link
              where a user can submit their OTPs. Once the link is clicked a
              hacker will have access to the users personal information.
              <br />
              Phishing is the common form of cyber attack due to its
              effectiveness and simplistic execution pattern.

          <div class="mitm">
            <h1>Man-in-the-middle attack (MITM)</h1>
            <br />
            <h2>
              A man-in-the-middle attack (MITM) consists of a message
              interception between two parties in an attempt to spy on the
              targets.
              <br />
              Due to the advent of end-to-end encryption, MITM attacks have
              taken a dip in frequency of attacks. Such encryptions prevent
              third parties in intercepting or tampering data transmitted in the
              network. Whether the network is secure or not is hardly a factor.

          </div>
          <div class="ddos">
            <h1>Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)</h1>
            <br />
            <h2>
              In a DDoS attack, an attacker floods a target server with traffic
              that will disrupt it. Since most servers cannot handle it, it may
              lead to services slowing down on the website and if it eventually
              crashes.
              <br />
              Unlike standard denial-of-service attacks, DDoS uses multiple
              compromised devices to bombard the target server, which
              sophisticated firewalls cannot respond to or are unable to.

          <div class="injection">
            <h1>SQL Injection</h1>
            <h2>
              This type of cyber attack targets specific SQL databases. These
              databases use SQL statements for data query. In case permissions
              are not set properly, a hacker can manipulate SQL queries into
              changing the data if not deleting them altogether.

            <br />
            <h2>
              When cyber-criminals learn of a vulnerability in a frequently used
              software application they target users and organizations using the
              software to exploit it until a fix is available. This is called a
              Zero-day exploit.

            <h1>DNS Tunnelling</h1>
            <br />
            <h2>
              A DNS Tunnelling provides attackers with a stable and consistent
              line of communication to the given target. The malware used will
              gather information as long as the DNS tunnelling is active.
              Chances are that firewalls won’t be able detect such an attack.

          <div class="bec">
            <h1>Business Email Compromise (BEC)</h1>
            <br />
            <h2>
              In a BEC attack, hackers target employees who have specific
              authority to finalize business transactions. They trick them into
              transferring money into an account belonging to the hacker.
              <br />
              BEC attacks are the most common, if not one of the most damaging
              attacks for a business firm.

            <br />
            <h2>
              Cryptojacking is used to target a computer in order to mine
              cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. The hackers will be able to get
              all the cryptocurrency they can instead of the original owners.
              Cryptojacking is not so widely known but its severity cannot be
              underestimated.

              A website is loaded with a malware, and when a visitor happens to
              come across such a website their device is infected with the
              malware. The malware will steal valuable data or crash the system.
